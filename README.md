Sorting
=======
In this repository, you will find a C language program capable of performing various basic sorting algorithms on a given array.      

Sorting Algorithms
------------------
I have written the codes for following sorting Algorithms:  
1. Bubble Sort  
2. Insertion Sort  
3. Selection Sort  
4. Quick Sort  
5. Merge Sort  

Brief of Sorting Algorithms
---------------------------
1. Bubble Sort  
Best case Complexity-O(n)  
Worst case Complexity-O(n^2)  
It is Stable.  
It is not Adaptive, though we can make it one.  
  
Note:  
* Stable means, if an element is already on a place which it should be after sorting, then it must be at the same place after sorting  
* Adaptive means if an array is already sorted then this will benefit this algo.  
  
2. Insertion Sort  
Best case Complexity-O(n)  
Worst case Complexity-O(n^2)  
It is Stable.  
It is Adaptive.  
  
3. Selection Sort  
Best case Complexity-O(n^2)  
Worst case Complexity-O(n^2)  
It is not Stable.  
It is not Adaptive.  
  
4. Quick Sort  
Best case Complexity(pivot will be in Mid)-O(nlogn)  
Average case Complexity-O(nlogn)  
Worst case Complexity(Already Sorted Elements)-O(n^2)  
It follows divide & conquer methodology.  
It is recursive.  
  
5. Merge Sort  
Best case Complexity-O(nlogn)  
Worst case Complexity-O(nlogn)  
It follows divide & conquer methodology.  
It is recursive.
